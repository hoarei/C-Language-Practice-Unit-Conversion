# C-Language-Practice
Personal programming project for practicing C-language 

I have decided to create a unit conversion program for easy conversion among common units, imperial and metric included. 

Version 1 (V1) - Completed
  Notes for Version 2 (V2):
    - Add timers for user interface convenience
    - Check spelling and phrase usage
    - Create feedback loop so program doesnt end when wrong key is pressed, else statements should lead back to main menu
    - Check formulas, some are simple approximations (for creation purposes), Look for more exact expressions
